# Spotify Clone with React and TailwindCSS 
### This is a spotify clone project with React and tailwindcss. It's a project I've done to improve myself on React and tailwind. When the project is finished, the music will turn into a platform that can be listened to like the original spotify. It is a responsive design.
## Tools:
- React
- React Router
- React Icons
- Redux
- React State and Props
- React Hooks
